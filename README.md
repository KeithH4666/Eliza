# Eliza Text Bot Project
My name is Keith Higgins and this is my christmas project for the module Data Representation and Querying. The project is a text bot called Eliza which mimics the responses of a physcotherapist. A link for the details of the original chatbot can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)

# How to run the program
The bot is written in the program language GO. If you havnt already installed GO heres a short [guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to do this.

# Steps:
1.git clone the repository.

2.Simply naviagte to the directory of the main.go file using CMD.

3.In your CMD type go build main.go (Creates an .exe file).

4.Open this exe file and in your browser type either http://localhost:8080/ or  127.0.0.1:8080 to see Eliza.

# Project Inspiration:

I based the whole project basically of the old version of Eliza but with upgraded visuals. The bot can give back general responses and responses that are related to your question. 

# Features:

* Features chat bubbles with name labels and timestamp of each conversation.

* Provides auto scroll so user can see latest chat.

* Has a delay to the responses to simulate a real conversation.

* Has a send sound when a message is sent.

* Has a 'responding..' label when Eliza is responding.

* Can tell the time and day by asking "What day is it/What time is it".
